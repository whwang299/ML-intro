# Style
- Physical science "derive" results by starting from the few postulates.
- "Theoretical coding" indicates this practice that derive algorithm from the very beginning without heavily relying on "memory" or already written codes.
- For this purpose, the path to the final results should be reachable with few steps.
- Mathematica with functional programming style is most suitable for this purpose because 
  - Mathematica is "symbolic" (few lines of symbols can represent abstract notions).
  - Functional programming style avoid loop and abstract them with "function" which makes code succinct and makes the path to the final results be short.
